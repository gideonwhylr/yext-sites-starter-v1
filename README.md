# yext-sites-starter-v1

This repo is an example of what the starter template for Yext Sites looks like. The goal is to illustrate a directory structure that is intuitive for new developers.  

The starter repo has the following Directories 

## /yext 
Contains all the configuration for how Yext should generate the site. 

**yext/pages** 
includes all the webpages that will be generated by Yext Sites. A separate file for each set of pages with a number of configuration directives. Each `page` file specifies meta data like the `template` the `url_template` and the `stream_data` for a page.  

**yext/features** 
includes other features of the site that are not consumer-visible web pages. Includes things such as `redirects`, `sitemaps`, etc. 

**yext/streamData**
includes configuration files that make it easy to set up M4 for your site. Users can add a set of files, each which specify (entity type, fields[]). The Yext system derives the required m4 configuration based on what the user has supplied. Each `streamData` file is meant to match to a `page` file.  

## /templates 
contains all the templates for the site. By convention, this is broken into two sub-directories 

**/templates/page_templates** 
contains templates which specify the HTML of the page, optionally including data from M4 

**/templates/url_templates** 
contains templates which specify the url structure of a page, optionally using data from M4

## /assets 
Contains all the static assets that need to be processed by CI including -- SCSS, JS, PNG, font files, etc 

## /static
Contains static assets that do not need to be processed by CI. These files are copied into the artifact repository as is.
